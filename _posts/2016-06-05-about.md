# About Me

* ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ccd000d-9f52-4228-8c08-70bea53ec656.jpg)

7+ years as a video and photo junkie and still going strong. Bachelors degree in Digital Media with an emphasis in Cinema production (although I'm more keen to shooting lifestyle media than be on a film set). But to be straight up honest, I still love every aspect of film and photography. I'm all about capturing those priceless moments so that the client or viewers can experience it to the fullest. 

I'll be posting more work from my portfolio this week, so you can get a better idea of what my style is.
